## What is the Snowball Method?
The **debt snowball** strategy focuses on paying off the **smallest debt balance first**, regardless of interest rate.

- Make **minimum payments** on all debts.
- Direct all **extra money** toward the **smallest loan**.
- Once cleared, roll that entire payment into the next smallest balance.

This creates a **snowball effect**, giving quick wins that build confidence.

## Example in INR
You have 3 debts:
- Credit card ₹1,00,000 at 36% APR  
- Personal loan ₹2,00,000 at 15% APR  
- Car loan ₹3,00,000 at 10% APR  

**Snowball order:**
1. Credit card (₹1L, smallest balance)  
2. Personal loan (₹2L)  
3. Car loan (₹3L)  

Even though the credit card has high interest, the **quick win** of eliminating ₹1L motivates further repayment momentum.

## Steps to Use the Snowball Method
1. **List all debts**: amount, interest rate, minimum EMI.  
2. **Rank them by balance** (smallest → largest).  
3. **Pay minimum EMIs** on all.  
4. **Channel surplus** into the smallest balance.  
5. Once cleared, **roll over** to the next.  
6. Repeat until debt-free.
