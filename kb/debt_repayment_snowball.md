The **snowball method** helps pay off debt faster by focusing on momentum.

**Steps:**  
1. List all debts by balance (ignore interest rates).  
2. Pay minimums on all, put extra money toward the smallest debt.  
3. Once cleared, roll freed-up money into the next debt.  
4. Continue until all debts are gone.

**Why it works:**  
- Builds quick wins → keeps motivation high.  
- Simplifies complex debt into a clear path.  

**Example:**  
- Credit card: ₹20,000  
- Personal loan: ₹50,000  
- Car loan: ₹200,000  

Focus all extra cash on the credit card → free cash → personal loan → car loan.
