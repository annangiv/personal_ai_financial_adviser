## What is the Avalanche Method?
The **debt avalanche** strategy prioritizes loans with the **highest interest rate**, regardless of balance size.

- Make **minimum payments** on all debts.
- Direct all **extra money** toward the **highest-interest loan**.
- After it’s cleared, roll over that payment into the next highest rate.

This minimizes **total interest paid** and helps you get out of debt faster overall.

---

## Example in INR
You have 3 debts:
- Credit card ₹1,00,000 at 36% APR (3% per month)  
- Personal loan ₹2,00,000 at 15% APR  
- Car loan ₹3,00,000 at 10% APR  

**Avalanche order:**
1. Credit card (36%) → kills the costliest debt first  
2. Personal loan (15%)  
3. Car loan (10%)  

If you can pay **₹10,000 extra/month**, put it entirely on the credit card until cleared, then snowball into the personal loan.

## Steps to Use the Avalanche Method
1. **List all debts**: amount, interest rate, minimum EMI.  
2. **Rank them by interest rate** (highest → lowest).  
3. **Pay minimum EMIs** on all.  
4. **Channel surplus** into the top-ranked debt.  
5. Once cleared, **roll over** to the next.  
6. Repeat until debt-free.

## Benefits
- Pays off debt **fastest mathematically**.  
- **Lowest total interest** paid over time.  
- Encourages **discipline** and good repayment habits.

## Drawbacks

- Can be **demotivating** vs. the Snowball method (which shows quick small wins).

---

## Who Should Use Avalanche?
- People with **high-interest debt** (credit cards, payday loans).  
- Comfortable with delayed gratification.  
- Focused on **saving the most money** overall.
