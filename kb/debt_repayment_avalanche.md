The **avalanche method** saves the most money by minimizing interest.

**Steps:**  
1. List debts by interest rate.  
2. Pay minimums on all.  
3. Direct extra payments to the **highest interest rate debt** first.  
4. Once cleared, move to the next highest.  

**Why it works:**  
- Reduces total interest paid.  
- Shortens repayment timeline.  

**Best for:**  
Disciplined earners who can stay motivated without quick wins.
