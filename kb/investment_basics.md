Investing grows wealth beyond savings accounts.

**Principles:**  
- Match investments with goals & risk tolerance.  
- Diversify → don't put all money in one asset.  
- Think long-term.

**Asset Classes:**  
- **Equity (stocks, mutual funds)** → higher risk, higher return.  
- **Debt (bonds, FDs)** → safer, lower returns.  
- **Real estate, gold** → diversifiers.  

**Tip:** Start small with SIPs in index funds.
