An **emergency fund** is savings set aside for unexpected events like medical bills, job loss, or urgent travel.

**Target Size:**  
- **3–6 months of expenses** for most households.  
- **6–12 months** if income is unstable or self-employed.

**Where to keep it:**  
- High-yield savings accounts.  
- Fixed deposits with easy withdrawal.  
- Liquid mutual funds (for slightly higher returns).

**Tip:** Automate transfers each month to grow steadily.
