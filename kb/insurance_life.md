Life insurance protects dependents if the breadwinner dies.

**Types:**  
- **Term insurance** → pure protection, lowest cost.  
- **Whole life / ULIP** → mix of insurance + investment (more expensive).  

**Coverage Rule:**  
- **10–15× annual income** or enough to cover loans + dependents’ future needs.  

**Tip:** Term insurance is usually the best choice — low premium, high coverage.
