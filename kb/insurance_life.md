## Why Life Insurance?
- Provides **financial protection** for dependents if the policyholder dies.  
- Ensures **ongoing expenses, loans, and goals** (education, housing, retirement) are covered.  
- A safety net against income loss.  

---

## Who Needs It?
- Anyone with **dependents** (spouse, children, parents).  
- People with **loans** (home, education, personal loans).  
- Primary earners in families.  

---

## How Much Coverage?
- Rule of thumb: **10–15× annual income**.  
- Add outstanding **loan balances** and major **future goals** (kids’ education, retirement corpus).  
- Example: ₹15L annual income + ₹50L home loan → cover = ₹2–2.5 crore.  

---

## Best Type of Life Insurance
- **Term Insurance = Best choice**:  
  - Pure protection, low cost.  
  - No savings/investment features (keep those separate).  
- Avoid **endowment, ULIPs, money-back plans**: high cost, low cover.  

---

## Premiums (Indicative, Term Plan)
- Age 30, nonsmoker, ₹1 crore cover, 30-year term: **₹8,000–12,000/year**.  
- Age 40: ~2× higher.  
- Smokers: ~30–50% higher premiums.  

---

## What To Check Before Buying
- Claim settlement ratio (>95% preferred).  
- Policy tenure: ideally until retirement age (60–65).  
- Riders: accidental death/disability, critical illness (optional).  
- Avoid policies with forced savings components.  

---

## TL;DR
- If you have **dependents or debt**, you need life insurance.  
- Choose a **pure term plan** for maximum cover at lowest cost.  
- Coverage = 10–15× annual income + loans + future goals.  
- Review cover every 5 years or after big life events (marriage, kids, loan).
