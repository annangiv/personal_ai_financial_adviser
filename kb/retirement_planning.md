## Why Retirement Planning Matters
- Average life expectancy is increasing (80+ years in cities).  
- Rising healthcare costs and inflation.  
- Traditional family support is less reliable.

## Key Principles
1. **Start Early**  
   - Compounding works best when you invest for 20–30 years.  
   - Even ₹5,000/month at 12% CAGR for 30 years → ~₹1.75 crore.  

2. **Estimate Future Needs**  
   - Use 60–70% of your current expenses as a retirement baseline.  
   - Adjust for **6–7% annual inflation**.  

3. **Diversify Investments**  
   - Equity for growth.  
   - Debt instruments for stability.  
   - Government-backed savings for safety.

## Retirement Tools in India
- **EPF/VPF**: Employee Provident Fund; long-term corpus with tax benefits.  
- **NPS (National Pension System)**: Market-linked, flexible, extra tax deduction under 80CCD(1B).  
- **PPF (Public Provident Fund)**: Safe, 15-year lock-in, EEE tax status.  
- **Mutual Fund SIPs**: Equity/debt mix for growth and stability.  
- **Insurance-linked annuities**: Provide steady post-retirement income.

## Common Mistakes
- Starting too late (need to save much higher %).  
- Underestimating inflation.  
- Relying only on FDs or employer pension.  
- Ignoring healthcare and long-term care costs.  

---

## Step-by-Step Plan
1. **20s–30s**: Focus on equity SIPs, build emergency fund, get term + health insurance.  
2. **40s**: Balance equity and debt, target saving 25–30% of income.  
3. **50s**: Shift to safer debt instruments, preserve capital.  
4. **60+**: Use annuities, SWPs (Systematic Withdrawal Plans), and pensions for regular income.

## TL;DR
- Start early, save consistently.  
- Use a mix of EPF, NPS, PPF, and SIPs.  
- Adjust for inflation and plan healthcare.  
- Goal: **financial independence, not dependence on children**.
