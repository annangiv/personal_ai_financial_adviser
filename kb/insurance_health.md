## Why You Need Health Insurance
- Protects against **unexpected medical costs** (hospitalization, surgery, long-term treatment).  
- Prevents **financial strain** that could deplete savings or derail long-term goals.  
- Provides **peace of mind** for dependents.  

---

## How Much Coverage?
- At least **₹5–10 lakh sum insured** for individuals in urban areas.  
- Families should consider **₹15–25 lakh** (family floater).  
- Top-up/super-top-up plans can increase coverage at lower cost.  

---

## Types of Plans
1. **Individual Plans** – cover only one person.  
2. **Family Floater** – one policy covers entire family.  
3. **Top-Up & Super Top-Up** – extend coverage once base limit is crossed.  
4. **Critical Illness Riders** – lump-sum payout for major illnesses.

## What To Look For
- **Network hospitals**: cashless claim options.  
- **Claim settlement ratio**: higher = better.  
- **Room rent limits**: avoid restrictive caps.  
- **Pre- and post-hospitalization coverage**: minimum 30–60 days.  
- **Daycare procedures**: ensure wide coverage.

## Example Costs
- 30-year-old, ₹10 lakh cover ≈ ₹8,000–12,000/year.  
- Family floater (2 adults + 2 kids), ₹20 lakh cover ≈ ₹20,000–30,000/year.  

---

## TL;DR
- Health insurance is **non-negotiable** for financial security.  
- Coverage should match city, lifestyle, and dependents.  
- Compare policies based on **coverage + claim settlement**, not just premium.
