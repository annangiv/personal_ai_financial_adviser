Health insurance protects against unexpected medical costs.

**Why:**  
- Prevents wiping out savings in emergencies.  
- Covers hospitalization, critical illnesses, maternity.  

**Guidelines:**  
- Cover = at least **5× annual income**.  
- Family floater if married/with kids.  
- Add critical illness rider if family history exists.

**Tip:** Buy early → premiums are lower and coverage broader.
