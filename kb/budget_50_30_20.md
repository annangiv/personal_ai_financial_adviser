The **50/30/20 rule** is a simple way to structure monthly income:

- **50% Needs** → rent, groceries, transport, healthcare, utilities.
- **30% Wants** → eating out, entertainment, travel, shopping.
- **20% Savings/Debt Repayment** → emergency funds, investments, debt paydown.

**Example (₹60,000 income):**
- Needs → ~₹30,000  
- Wants → ~₹18,000  
- Savings → ~₹12,000  

**Adaptations:**
- Tier 1 → Needs may reach 60%.  
- Students/early-career → save at least 10%.  
- Affluent → can push savings to 30–35%.
