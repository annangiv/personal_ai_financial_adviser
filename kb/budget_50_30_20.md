## What is the 50/30/20 Rule?
A quick budgeting framework:
- **50% Needs**: essential, unavoidable costs (rent, basic groceries, utilities, transport EMIs).
- **30% Wants**: non-essential lifestyle spends (eating out, shopping, subscriptions, vacations).
- **20% Savings/Debt**: emergency fund, investments, extra EMI prepayments, debt payoff.

It’s a **starting template**, not a law. Adjust percentages to your situation (e.g., high-rent city vs. living with family).

## INR Example (Monthly)
**Assume income ₹80,000/month (post-tax):**
- **Needs (50%)** → ₹40,000  
  _Rent 20k, Groceries 10k, Utilities 3k, Transport 5k, Phone/Internet 2k_
- **Wants (30%)** → ₹24,000  
  _Eating out 8k, Shopping 8k, Subscriptions 2k, Leisure/Travel 6k_
- **Savings/Debt (20%)** → ₹16,000  
  _Emergency Fund 8k, SIP/Investments 6k, Debt prepay 2k_

> If your **needs > 50%**, trim wants first, then slowly push needs down (renegotiate rent, switch plans, cut commuting costs).

## How to Implement in 20 Minutes
1. **List monthly income (net).**
2. **Categorize spends** from last 1–2 months into Needs/Wants/Debt (bank app or spreadsheet).
3. **Set caps**: Needs ≤ 50%, Wants ≤ 30%, Savings ≥ 20%.
4. **Automate savings** on salary day (SIPs, recurring transfers).  
5. **Track weekly**: if Wants hit 30% cap early, pause discretionary spends.

## Adapting by Income & City Tier
- **High-rent or metro (Mumbai, BLR, NCR)**: try **60/20/20** (Needs/Wants/Savings) initially, then work back to 50/30/20.
- **Living with family**: push to **40/20/40** to fast-track goals.
- **Debt-heavy phase**: keep Savings/Debt at **≥ 20%**; direct more to EMIs/prepayment until interest burden drops.

## Building the Savings Portion (20%)
Priorities inside the **20%** bucket:
1. **Emergency Fund**: 3–6 months of expenses (start with 1 month, build up).
2. **Short-term goals** (≤ 3 years): RD/short-duration debt funds.
3. **Long-term goals** (retirement, child edu): Equity index funds via SIPs.
4. **High-interest debt**: Avalanche (highest rate first) or Snowball (smallest balance first) methods.

## Quick Self-Check
- Needs > 55% for >3 months? → **Housing/transport plan** review.
- Savings < 15%? → Auto-transfer on salary day; cut recurring Wants.
- Emergency fund < 1 month? → Make it priority #1 inside the 20%.

---

## Common Pitfalls
- **Calling Wants “Needs.”** Dining out, premium subscriptions, and cab upgrades are Wants.  
- **No automation.** If savings aren’t automated, Wants creep up.  
- **No review.** Rebalance caps after major life changes (move city, job change, marriage, child).

---

## When NOT to Use 50/30/20 as-is
- **Very low income / high fixed costs** → start 60/20/20 or even 70/10/20, then improve.
- **Aggressive debt payoff** → make **Savings/Debt 30–40%** temporarily.
- **Irregular income (freelance)** → budget on **last month’s income** and keep a bigger buffer.
