   - Real estate or REITs  
   - Alternative assets (gold, digital gold, ETFs)

## Rules of Thumb
- If savings rate is **40–60%** → prioritize **growth assets** (equity).  
- If savings rate is **60%+** → balance between **growth + preservation**.  
- Maintain at least **6 months’ expenses** in an emergency fund even if income is high.

## Example in INR
- Monthly income = ₹2,00,000  
- Monthly spend = ₹80,000

- 40% Equity (₹48,000)  
- 20% Debt funds/FDs (₹24,000)  
- 20% Retirement/Pension (₹24,000)  
- 10% Real estate/REITs (₹12,000)  
- 10% Gold/Alternatives (₹12,000)

## TL;DR
- High savers should **focus on long-term wealth creation**, not just saving.  
- Diversify across asset classes.
