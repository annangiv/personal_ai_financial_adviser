## How Big a Corpus?
- **Rule of thumb**: Annual expenses × **25–30** (assumes 3.3–4% safe withdrawal rate).
- For India (higher inflation), use **3.5% SWR** as a conservative start.
- Example: Monthly spend ₹80,000 → yearly ₹9.6L → corpus target ≈ **₹2.4–2.9 crore**.

---

## Asset Allocation Glidepath
- **10–15+ years to retirement**: Equity 60–80%, Debt 20–40%.
- **5–10 years**: Gradually shift to Equity 40–60%, Debt 40–60%.
- **At retirement**: Equity 30–45%, Debt 45–65%, Gold 5–10%.
- Rebalance **once a year** or if any asset drifts by **±5–10%**.

---

## Withdrawal Strategies
- **SWR (3.5–4%)**: Withdraw inflation-adjusted % yearly.
- **Dynamic Guardrails**: Start 3.5%; trim 10–15% in years when portfolio falls >10%.
- **Buckets**:  
  - Bucket 1 (2–3 years): cash/ultra-short debt for expenses.  
  - Bucket 2 (3–7 years): short/intermediate debt.  
  - Bucket 3 (7+ years): equity for growth.  
  Refill Bucket 1 from gains in 2 & 3.

---

## India-Specific Tools
- **EPF/VPF**: Stable debt-like base; use for Bucket 2 post-retirement (via SWP after withdrawal rules).
- **NPS**: Low-cost; up to **60% lump sum**, **40% annuity** at exit. Choose equity/debt mix per risk.
- **PPF**: Tax-free EEE; can serve as safer Bucket 2 component.
- **SGB/Gold ETFs**: 5–10% hedge; avoid overweight.
- **Annuities**: Consider for guaranteed income covering **non-negotiable expenses**.

---

## Taxes (Indicative)
- **Equity MF/LTCG** (held >1yr): Concessional rates (law changes possible).  
- **Debt MF**: Tax as per current regime; check latest rules.  
- **EPF/PPF**: Favorable but with limits/conditions.  
- Use **SWP** for tax efficiency vs. taking large redemptions.

---

## Sequence-of-Returns Risk
- First 5–10 retired years are critical.  
- Keep **2–3 years** expenses outside equity.  
- Cut withdrawals in bad years; harvest gains in good years.

---

## Healthcare & Insurance
- Maintain **adequate health insurance** separate from employer; add **super top-up**.  
- Build a **medical buffer fund** (~1 year expenses) if possible.

---

## Annual Checklist
- Rebalance to target mix.  
- Review expenses & withdrawal rate.  
- Refill buckets.  
- Tax-loss harvesting (where permitted).  
- Update nominees, wills, and SIP/SWP instructions.

---

## TL;DR
- Target corpus = **25–30× annual expenses** (3.5–4% SWR).  
- Use **buckets** + annual **rebalance** to manage risk.  
- Optimize with **EPF/NPS/PPF**, consider annuity for essentials.  
- Protect healthcare; be tax- & sequence-aware.
